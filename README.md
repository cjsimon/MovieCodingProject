## Development

### Requirements

#### OS Level Requirements

All development has been done on a Linux machine using a relatively modern version of bash. Bash is required.

If working on Windows, you need to be using [Git for Windows's GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win). Cmd Prompt and PowerShell are not directly supported; Windows is a second-class support platform for this project.

#### Project Level Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/) for version control
- [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation) for local development using containers
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >=3.8 on the host machine

##### Optional Requirements

- [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html#getting-started) Makes it easy to manage varying versions of various OS Level binaries. You can use it to install the needed Podman, Python and DirEnv versions for this project alongside other versions of those tools for other projects.
- [DirEnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) is supported for optional, convenient, pre-defined directory-level bash functions and aliases, to further simplify project level tasks and processes.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) with code formatting and debugging pre-setup, so long as [the recommended extensions](.vscode/extensions.json) are installed. See: `.vscode/extensions.json`
