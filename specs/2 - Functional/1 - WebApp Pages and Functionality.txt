Movie Search Page:

- Search bar on top. List of movies below

- The search bar should make the appropriate calls to fetch the corresponding data requested according to the search query
  - Data can come from both the API, and potentially pre-fetched/cached data that could either exist on disk, as images might, or could exist in the database, as could simpler data types

- There should be an option to fetch and display the User's list of Favorite'd movies

For each movie in the list of movies, display:
  - title
  - year
  - rating

- Upon clicking a movie from the list, show more info
  - Explore the possibility of using a pseudo "new" page, or a popup of sorts that comes in front of the existing page, so that the existing movie results data is preserved and not unloaded while it may still be needed

Movie Details Page:

Details for a selected Movie

- Don't redirect, just render over the Movie Search Results Page

- Display:
  - plot
  - director
  - actors

On this "new" page, an option to save the movie to the database as a favorite should be implemented. Also a back button to "return to the previous page"
